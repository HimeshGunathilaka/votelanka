## FAQ

#### What did you use as a database ?

I have used postgres as database system in this project. so make sure to install postgres in your pc/laptop before
running.

#### What is the jdk version you used in this project ?

I have used amazon corretto - version 20 as the jdk for this project. it is not essential to use exact jdk but make sure
to use a jdk with version higher than 17.

#### How can i manage my database ? is there a tool for it ?

You can use pgadmin4 as your database management system in order to check status of your current database. it is like
wammp server or xammp server. but it is for postgresql.
